# My Node Project

This is a Node.js project that includes TypeScript, Jest, and ESM.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

```
my-node-project
├── src
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── utils
│       └── helper.ts
├── tests
│   └── index.test.ts
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── jest.config.js
└── README.md
```

- `src/index.ts`: This file is the entry point of the application. It contains the main code for your Node.js application.
- `src/utils/helper.ts`: This file exports a function or a class that provides utility functions or helper methods for your application.
- `tests/index.test.ts`: This file contains the test cases for your application. It uses the Jest testing framework to run the tests.
- `package.json`: This file is the configuration file for npm. It lists the dependencies and scripts for the project. It includes scripts for starting the program (`npm run start`) and running the tests (`npm run test`).
- `tsconfig.json`: This file is the configuration file for TypeScript. It specifies the compiler options and the files to include in the compilation.
- `jest.config.js`: This file is the configuration file for Jest. It specifies the settings and options for running the tests.
- `README.md`: This file contains the documentation for the project.

## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or create a new directory called `my-node-project`.
2. Inside the `my-node-project` directory, create a `src` directory.
3. Inside the `src` directory, create an `index.ts` file. This will be the entry point of your application.
4. Inside the `src` directory, create a `utils` directory.
5. Inside the `utils` directory, create a `helper.ts` file. This file will contain your utility functions or helper methods.
6. Create a `tests` directory in the root of the project.
7. Inside the `tests` directory, create an `index.test.ts` file. This file will contain your test cases.
8. Create a `package.json` file in the root of the project. Add the necessary dependencies and scripts for running the program and tests.
9. Create a `tsconfig.json` file in the root of the project. Configure the TypeScript compiler options and specify the files to include in the compilation.
10. Create a `jest.config.js` file in the root of the project. Configure Jest with the necessary settings and options.
11. Create a `README.md` file in the root of the project. Add documentation for your project.

## Running the Program

To start the program, run the following command:

```
npm run start
```

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```
npm run test
```

```

Please note that this is just the contents of the `README.md` file. You will need to create the other files and configure them accordingly as mentioned in the project specification.
